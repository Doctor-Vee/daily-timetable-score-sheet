Thursday 16/04 - Tuesday 21/04 ------ See HP EliteBook ----- My HP Elite book was what I was using since the lockdown began but on Tuesday 21/04, the laptop refused to boot up to desktop. It was throwing an error "BOOTMGR image is corrupt. The system cannot boot." I checked online and tried to solve the issue but the solutions I saw online didn't work for me. Eventually though, it seemed like the issue got worse and booting from a bootable USBrefused to work. I had to put off the system and resort to using only this one alone.

I went to the office based on the conversation I had with Justin about him helping out with some stuffs I needed on the Jaiz project but I couldn't do much at the office... I was just feeling so sleepy and unproductive as much as I tried to work. In addition to that I wasted serious time in traffic especially while returning home. Also, Francisca got a job with Union Bank today!!!  
Tuesday 02/06 - Tasks (7/10) = 70%  
Wednesday 03/06 --- Had 3 hour-long standup meeting and an interview with Lateral/Decagon. Today's standup took extremely long as Jerry brought a topic of discussion that took really long for us to decide on. The aspects of discussion related to his fight with the management yesterday about iOS lagging far behind in comparison with Android as well as the management's decision about salaries where we were being forced to open Mint accounts. Our discussion eventually took about 3 hours. In addition to this, I had an interview with Lateral VC ... an investment company that was looking to partner with Decagon in hiring Decadevs... Decagon chose a few of us from different squads to have this interview with them. It seemed like they wanted to use the assessment they had of us to make a more general assessment of the kind of software developers that are produced from Decagon.

I thought they were the same as Union Bank and didn't bother to check them out online ... I was calling Lewis and Ebuka instead because they just got into Union Bank not knowing that these people were entirely different. When they asked me what I knew about them, I was saying they were the same as Union Bank and they showed their disappointment at the fact that I did not even check them up online ... Right now, as I type this, when I think of what transpired between us, I feel so embarrassed at how the interview went. Well, let God's will be done. I guess I'll need to prepare better next time and avoid assumptions. Sadly too, I was distracted by my BS and that made me waste hours that I could have used productively which is why I had only 60% today when I could have easily reached 80%

I lost quite an amount of useful time, unlike before that I would have done my quiet time before devotion and I would have used the remaining time before standup to cover up for the tasks that had not been completed the previous day. Well, I've made up my mind to stop eating late. I set daily alarms to eat at 7am, 11am, 3pm and 7pm...

To worsen the whole thing, the endpoint the Jaiz team released for the implementation was a lot complicated ... it was something I didn't really know properly at the time ... It dealt with xml, encryption and decryption ... For a major part of the day, my head was aching ... I had to take Paracetamol ... I barely had enough time to sleep. It just wasn't easy ...
